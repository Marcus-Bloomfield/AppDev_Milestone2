### Description
A workout tracking app to record exercises and display weekly data for users.

### Scope

#### Login
The app starts out in a login screen which prevents the user from access to our app until logged in.

##### Note: 
When the user makes a log in/sign in request, the app sends a post or get request to the database and signs the user in. 

#### Home Page
After the login/sign in screen, the user is redirected to the home screen which will have user information displayed and buttons to the workout logger and the workout viewer pages.

##### Note: 
The AI will be Azure OpenAI Service
[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/ai-services/openai-service/)

#### Workout Planner

On the workout planner page, the page will have numerous features including a box to select the date you're doing the workout, a container to write the name of your workout, some drop downs for the sets and reps per workout and an add workout button to do a post request to the database.
