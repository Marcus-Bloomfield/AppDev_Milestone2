### Description
A workout tracking app to record exercises and display weekly data for users.

### Scope
The app starts out in a login/sign in screen which prevents the user from access to our app until logged in. When the user makes a log in/sign in request, the app sends a post or get request to the database and signs the user in. After the login/sign in screen, the user is redirected to the home screen which will have user information displayed and buttons to the workout logger and the workout viewer pages. On the workout logger page, the page will have numerous features including a box to select the date you did the workout, a container to write the name of your workout, some drop downs for the sets and reps per workout and an add workout button to do a post request to the database. In the view workout page, the workouts will be shown in a weekly format, with all the information shown with the day of the week, the name and the other workout info. You also have the option to edit your workout.
